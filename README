sendfakekey
===========

Written by Peter Ebden <peter.ebden@gmail.com>

This is a bit of a mashup of xsendkey (which can be found at
http://people.csail.mit.edu/adonovan/hacks/xsendkey.html) and libfakekey
(http://matchbox-project.org). libfakekey is included for its cunning
keyboard remapping tricks; when a key is not on the physical keyboard
there won't be a keycode associated with its keysym so you can't send it
to X. libfakekey fixes this by adding new keysym mappings as needed. However,
its use of XTestFakeKeyEvent doesn't seem to work for me; I don't seem
to get the characters appearing when it's run from some background app
(particularly xbindkeys). This is where xsendkey comes in, which I have
copied a bunch of code from which detects the currently focused window
and sends events directly through XSendEvent.

All of this seems to work for my test case which is making Alt+4 send a 
sterling sign to aid my survival in the UK with a NZ (US) keyboard.

There are various extensions that could be made here; the most obvious
being dealing with modifier keys. Currently I haven't bothered because
I don't need them, and I'm hoping to avoid creeping featureitis in this case.
